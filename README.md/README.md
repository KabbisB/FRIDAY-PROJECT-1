Setup
he function of a resume is to give prospective employers enough information about you so that they invite will you for an interview. In order to write it effectively, you need to focus on how your skills and experiences directly relate to the position you are applying for. Request the detailed staff position description from the contact listed on the job advertisement, it will help you to tailor your resume. Your resume is the first impression that recruiters and hiring managers will have of you – time and effort on your part can be a very worthwhile investment so your resume should address the following:

Clear: Whoever reads your resume should have a clear understanding of who you are, what skills you possess, your accomplishments and the career path you have chosen up to this point.

Concise: There should be a reason why every word is on your resume. Are there redundant phrases? Review your resume and determine if all the content is indeed making you a stronger candidate.

Consistent: If your resume is in a consistent format, your readers will be focusing on what you have written, not how you have written it. Is your resume visually easy on the eyes? Make sure that you have ample white space on your resume; the resume should be inviting to read.

Make it easy to find out what you are good at: For most people, this is the most challenging part of your resume. If you don’t market yourself on your resume, the reader won’t be able to read between the lines. Focus on your achievements, strengths and skills. The more you work on your resume, the more that you will learn and understand about your own strengths and skills. You will be more comfortable articulating those skills and experiences in an interview situation.
